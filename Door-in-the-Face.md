# Door-in-the-Face

## Explanation

The Door-in-the-Face technique is a persuasion strategy that involves making a large request, which is expected to be refused, followed by a smaller, more reasonable request. The idea is that the person is more likely to comply with the smaller request after refusing the larger one.

## Real-World Example

Let's say you want your friend to help you move to a new apartment, but you know it's a big favor and they might be reluctant to agree. You can use the Door-in-the-Face technique like this:

1. Start with the Large Request: Ask your friend if they can help you move all your furniture and belongings to the new apartment on a specific date. This is a significant request that they might be hesitant to accept due to the time and effort involved.

2. Wait for the Refusal: Chances are, your friend might decline the large request, stating various reasons like prior commitments, being busy, or not having enough time.

3. Present the Smaller Request: Now, after their refusal, you present the smaller request. Ask if they could just help you with a few boxes or smaller items instead of the entire move. This request seems more reasonable and manageable in comparison to the first one.

## Psychological Explanation

The Door-in-the-Face technique works based on the principle of reciprocity and the desire to maintain consistency in social interactions. When someone declines a large request, they may feel the need to reciprocate in some way to maintain a sense of fairness. The smaller request, which follows the initial refusal, appears more reasonable in comparison, making it more likely for the person to agree.

It's important to note that while this technique can be effective, it should be used ethically and with consideration for the other person's feelings and boundaries. Respect their decision if they decline both requests and avoid applying undue pressure or manipulation.
